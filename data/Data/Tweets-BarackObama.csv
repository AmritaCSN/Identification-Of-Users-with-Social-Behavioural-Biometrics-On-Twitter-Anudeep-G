Obama,A voice everybody should hear.https://twitter.com/ncaawbb/status/1113842633481310212 …
Obama,Here’s a story about people doing good that's worth sharing: @BradPaisley and his wife @Kimwilliamspais saw food insecurity in Nashville and decided to do something about it. They just broke ground on a free grocery store to help families in need:https://apnews.com/2f5bdd226a674fd7bd9dca97c172475c …
Obama,Great to see Chicago’s historic mayoral race between two highly qualified candidates. Congrats to our next mayor Lori Lightfoot—and Toni Preckwinkle campaigned hard and did us proud. I know that with our city’s heart and Lori’s leadership Chicago’s best days are still ahead.
Obama,Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know “Finding My Voice” will inspire others to lift their voices too.pic.twitter.com/nWTBDByMoz
Obama,Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress—it's a young diverse class stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who’ve taken the torch. This group is going to be driving progress for a long time to come.pic.twitter.com/W5dDlDtNzE

Obama,. @BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France offering them job training and language immersion as well as a place to stay.

Obama,I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah Moussa Sandor Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn’t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it.
Obama,Leaders like Jonny Boucher a Chicago native who after losing too many friends and family to suicide started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day.pic.twitter.com/H6XPceR6d9
